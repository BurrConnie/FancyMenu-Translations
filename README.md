#About
This repository contains all localizations for FancyMenu and a template (in English) for people who want to help translate the mod.

# "I want to help!"
Great! It's really easy, just download/copy the [template](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu-Translations/blob/main/template/en_us.txt) from this repository and start translating!

### "What should I translate?"
Most of the time, it's simply translating everything **after** the **first** equals sign (=).

Every text line in the template looks similar to this:<br>
`helper.creator.layoutempty.title = Layout is empty!`

In this example, you should translate `Layout is empty!` to your target language.<br>
Everything before the equals sign (`helper.creator.layoutempty.title`) needs to stay the same, otherwise the mod can't find the text anymore.

### "There are weird codes in the text, what to do with them?"
If you look at the template, you will find various Minecraft formatting codes like `ยงc` or `ยง3`.<br>
These codes are there to colorize/format the text **after** the certain code.<br>
If you see one of these, please don't remove it, just translate the normal text and move the formatting code if you move the text after it.

The other code you will find in the template is `%n%`.<br>
This is the `newline` code I'm using to tell the mod to switch to the next line.
